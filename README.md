# Angora FDTD

This is a port of [Angora: A free finite-difference time-domain (FDTD) electromagnetic 
simulation package](http://www.angorafdtd.org/) for the macOS operating system. There
is an accompanying [homebrew tap](https://github.com/drjrkuhn/homebrew-angora) to install 
Angora on your mac.

Make sure [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/index.html) is already installed. Then run

```bash
$ brew update
$ brew tap drjrkuhn/homebrew-angora
$ brew install angora
```

Angora should be installed to `/usr/local/bin/angora`

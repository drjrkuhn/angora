We only had to make sure that the updates were consistent with the TL equations. The rest was taken care of by the 1-D TF/SF corrections in the 1-D grid.

Otherwise, the H-field in the 1-D grid would have the opposite sign relative to the E-field for a downward-propagating wave, which is inconsistent with the desired plane wave in the  main grid.
